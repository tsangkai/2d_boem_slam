# 2D Block Online EM SLAM Simulation

Comparision between the batch EM and the block online EM for the SLAM problem.

The EM algorithm is separate from the SLAM simulation. In othe words, both SLAM algorithms use the same EM implementation.

However, I stick to the simple linear model now. The extension to the nonlinear model needs the extended RTS smoother and the nonlinear optimizater later on.
